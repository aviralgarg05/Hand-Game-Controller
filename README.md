# Hand controller: control cars ðŸš— using hands, in Games

This project uses the Python OpenCV module to detect hand gestures and control a car in any game. By using computer vision techniques, the program captures the movements of the user's hand and translates them into corresponding actions in the game. This allows the user to drive the car, change directions, and perform other actions simply by moving their hand in front of the camera.


## Installation

Run the following command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

#### Using PC camera:
- Run `main-pc-cam.py`

#### Using Mobile camera:
- Download IP Webcam App in your mobile and put the IP in the `url` variable in code
- then simply run `main-mobile-cam.py`

And put your hand in front of the Camera to control the CAR!
